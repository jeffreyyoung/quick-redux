# quick-redux

## Getting started

`npm install --save quick-redux`

React, redux and react-redux are required as peer dependencies so if you're starting a project from scratch you could run

```
  npx create-react-app quick-redux-test
  cd quick-redux-test
  npm i --save redux react-redux quick-redux
```
